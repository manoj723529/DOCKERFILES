# -------- Stage 1: Build Stage --------
# Use Ubuntu 20.04 as the base image for building the application
FROM ubuntu:20.04 AS stage-1

# Avoid interactive prompts during package installation (e.g., timezone settings)
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Update package lists to prepare for installation
RUN apt update -y

# Install Maven and Git (for building Java projects and cloning repos)
RUN apt install maven git -y

# Install OpenJDK 11 to compile and run Java code
RUN apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

# Clone the Java web application repository from GitHub
RUN git clone https://github.com/Saiviratvk/vprofile-project.git

# Set working directory to the cloned project directory

# Use Maven to compile the project and package it into a .war file
RUN mvn package

# Use the official Tomcat image with OpenJDK 11 as the runtime environment
FROM tomcat:9-jdk11

# Copy the WAR file built in the previous stage into Tomcat's webapps directory
COPY --from=stage-1 vprofile-project/target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

# Set permissions so Tomcat can access and serve the WAR file
RUN chmod -R 755 /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

# Expose port 8080 so the application can be accessed from the host
EXPOSE 8080

# Start Tomcat in the foreground (keeps the container running)
