# -------- Stage 1: Build the Java WAR file using Maven --------
FROM ubuntu:latest AS manoj  # Use Ubuntu as the base image for building

# Update package list and install OpenJDK 17, Maven, and Git
RUN apt update -y && \
    apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk maven git && \
    apt clean  # Optional: clean up to reduce image size

# Clone the Java web calculator project from GitHub
RUN git clone https://github.com/manoj723529/JavaWebCalculator.git

# Set the working directory to the cloned project folder
WORKDIR JavaWebCalculator/

# Use Maven to build the project and generate a WAR file
RUN mvn package

# -------- Stage 2: Deploy the WAR file to Tomcat --------
FROM tomcat:9-jdk17  # Use official Tomcat image with JDK 17 for deployment

# Copy the generated WAR file from the builder stage to Tomcat's webapps directory
COPY --from=manoj JavaWebCalculator/target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/

# Optional: Set permissions so Tomcat can access the files
RUN chmod -R 755 /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

# Expose port 8080 so the application can be accessed from the host
EXPOSE 8080

# Start Tomcat in foreground (required for container to keep running)
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
